            <h1>Brynja's Nails</h1>
                <p>I started dabbling in doing my own gel nails at home back in 2022. I can now say that I have been doing my own nails consistanly for just over 2 years! Now that I have somewhere to post my nails, other than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/b_haven_nails/">Instagram</a>, I'll be taking better pictures. </p>

                        <p>December 1, 2025; These nails were yet again inspired by a pintrest post, but the peralesant chrome I have isnt the best quality, so I just did plain white for some nails, and the tortoiseshell for the design.</p>

                        <p>October 23, 2025; I really like this set of nails. I used to love halloween and stuff like that. So this was a little twist on something I saw on pintrest. Which I later found out was AI... oops</p>

                        <p>October 4, 2025; I wish I got a nice picture of my other hand as well. It had different elements but the same scheme as this hand. It was inspired by another pintrest post. I think this set of nails took me about 5.5 hours. Every nail had a different design, no solids.</p>

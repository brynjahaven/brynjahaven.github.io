        <h1>Writing</h1>

        <p>I used to love writing, dating back to my elementary school days. I would love to write non fiction stories about charaters I would draw with my brothers. Then in middle school and high school I continued to write creativly, I always loved english class, the homework not so much. I enjoyed learning how to create stories, or even just express myself. I would like to start to share some of my writing, so thats what this page is dedicated to.</p>
